#  Project Overview: Expansion of Eniac to the Brazilian Market via Magist

Eniac, the online marketplace for Apple-compatible devices, is planning to expand into Brazil. To facilitate this, Eniac is considering a 3-year partnership with Magist, a Brazilian Saas company that provides centralized procurement management and after-sales services.

## Eniac

## Key Concerns

**2. Delivery Speed:** Ensuring fast delivery standards are met.

## Tools Used
**SQL:** For querying and extracting data from databases.

**Tableau:** For importing CSV files, creating visualizations, and generating insightful charts.

**Google Slides:** For preparing and presenting the presentation.

## Deliverables

## Overcoming challenges
**Team development:** Initial difficulties in assessing the skills of team members were overcome through open communication and effective use of individual strengths.

**Concrete data:** Raw data transformed into clear, actionable insights, to ensure accuracy in analysis.

## Key Takeaways
**Market Growth:** Brazil’s eCommerce is expected to double by 2024.

**Product Alignment:** Eniac’s high-end accessories may not fit Magist’s range.

**Revenue Gap:** Magist’s earnings fall short of Eniac’s expectations.

**Regional Disparities:** Sales are uneven, with challenges in northern regions.

## Conclusion

Our study concludes that due to key concerns regarding product fit and scalability, it is advised to consider alternatives such as Mercado Libre, Novatrade, or the fulfillment services of major players like Amazon or Shopify before finalizing a contract with Magist.
